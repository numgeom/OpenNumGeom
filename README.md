# mCoupler
mCoupler is a mesh coupler for multiphysics applications. It supports mapping data between different meshes in 1-D, 2-D, and 3-D, including curves and surfaces. The meshes may occupy the same and even different domains.

Notable features include:
 - high accuracy and conservation
 - treatment of mismatch curves and surfaces
 - treatment of mismatch boundaries
 - support of different discretization methods, including finite element, finite volume, and even meshless methods
 - high-order methods, including FEM, DG, and AES-FEM supported
 - treatment of discontinuities in solutions (and in curves and surfaces)
 - C/C++ & Fortran API
 - Python and MATLAB API
 - multithreaded implementation of solution transfer
